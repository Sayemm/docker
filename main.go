What is Docker?
---------------
- Old days loading to the ship was hectic (barrels, boxes were used)
- Then container comes into the play - storing/load/unload.. become earlier

- Dock - (Ferighat)
- Docker - Person who loads unloads container at dock / Longshoreman / Stevedore
- Docker - Container loads/unloads to the ship (computer)
- Container (OS, Software, dependency....)
- Image - Container screenshot
- Can give/distribute this image to another one
	- run using docker in another PC
	- That imgae will create another identical container

=> Docker is a platform
